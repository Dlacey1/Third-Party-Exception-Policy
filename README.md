By assessing risks associated with specific vendor relationships, the company can make informed decisions and implement appropriate mitigating measures.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance Requirements:</strong> Compliance with regulatory standards and industry best practices is paramount. The policy ensures that any exceptions granted align with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Continuity:</strong> While adhering to established controls is crucial, the policy recognizes that certain situations may necessitate deviations to ensure business continuity and operational efficiency. Exception requests are evaluated based on their impact on business operations and the necessity of the proposed deviation.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation and Oversight:</strong> Clear documentation and oversight mechanisms are established to ensure transparency and accountability in the exception management process. This includes maintaining records of exception requests, approvals, and any associated risk assessments or mitigating controls.</li>
